        <p class="home-text">Thinking of buying you a new bicycle? One of your first choices, and not necessarily an easy one, will be where to shop. It can be a challenge because there are a myriad of stores that carry two-wheelers, from specialty retailers, to giant department stores, to backyard garage operations. <br>
        A quality two-wheeler, carefully assembled and fitted, will be the safest, most durable and fun bicycle to ride. <br>
        That's why we strongly recommend shopping at The Mountain Spoke. Here you'll find competent salespeople and expert mechanics who'll ensure that you get the right bike and a quality machine. </p>
